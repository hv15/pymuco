A *Python Music Converter*
==========================

Goals:

 * Convert any (compatible?) audio format to mp3 or ogg
 * Recursively copy over all static content from current directory structure,
   including images
 * Apply ReplayGain onto newly created mp3
 * If missing (or required), apply IDv2/3 with latest records from freetag
 * Rename directories/files

Why:

I have used several scripts, be they Shell, Python, or Ruby based to batch
convert files to mp3, however all of them have been clunky to say the least. I
want to create something structured and powerful to use. As simple as typing in
`pymuco . /newdir`, and it just works. I have been working a lot with Python
over the last few months, and think I have a good understand of how to make
this app.

Pronounciation: Ha, really?
